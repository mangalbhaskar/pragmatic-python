Introduction

Programming languages are no different from spoken language in the way it has its own structure, vocabulary, grammar and punctuation. If you want to develop a good spoken language skill, no matter how good is your vocabulary or grammar, it demands conversing about general things regularly. Likewise, is the case for any programming language. I do believe that the conventional book on the subject is essential which covers concepts in chronological order, though its aim is different. 

‘Pragmatic Python’ book answers to many of the ‘How to…?’ questions for python in the daily routine work of a software engineer. It’s based on the contextual learning concept which focuses on to provide you with the quick fix code snippets with explanation for a specific task. I have handpicked and refined answers to many of the problems I’d faced when I started to use python as front line programming language for data science, machine learning and deep learning.

Intended readers are the people who are new to python with some programming exposure.

This book aims to save your time by providing a code snippet to different problems. It is also intended to help you to build a conceptual understanding of python fundamentals through code examples. Last but not the least, this gives you the holistic view of the python ecosystem.

In the e-book format the hyperlinks enables to you look at the detailed explanations over the internet.
How ‘not’ to use this book? Do not just ‘read the book’ rather it’s meant to ‘do the book’.
How to use this book? You need to write the code and work along. The ‘Getting Started’ section let you setup your learning python environment in less then 10 minutes.
